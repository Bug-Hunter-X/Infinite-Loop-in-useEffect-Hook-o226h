This repository demonstrates a common React bug: an infinite loop caused by an incorrectly used useEffect hook. The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version. The issue stems from the dependency array in useEffect, which should prevent the effect from running infinitely. The solution demonstrates the proper dependency array management to avoid this common pitfall.
